== Introduction

HackEat is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for ordering food*. More importantly, HackEat is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HackEat can get food to your door in no time. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
