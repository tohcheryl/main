== Introduction

HackEat is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for ordering food*. More importantly, HackEat is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HackEat can get food to your door in no time. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `hackeat.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all food
* **`add`**`n/Sweet Chili Fish Burger p/67773777 e/hanbaobao@mcds.sg a/10 Jalan Serene, #01-01, Serene Centre` : adds a food called `Sweet Chili Fish Burger` to HackEat.
